## 🎯 Workshop Overview

This workshop introduces fundamental concepts in **quantitative genetics** with applications in genomic selection and breeding. It is part of the Innovation Lab for Crop Improvement’s **QuickWin project**.

Participants will gain theoretical knowledge and practical skills for analyzing genetic data using R, with an emphasis on **genomic prediction**.

---

## 🧠 Learning Objectives

By the end of this workshop, participants will be able to:
- Understand the basic principles of **quantitative inheritance**.
- Describe the genetic and environmental components of phenotypic variance.
- Apply **linear models** to estimate genetic effects.
- Understand and implement basic concepts of **genomic selection**.

## 📚 Course Materials

The workshop draws from the following textbooks:

- *Introduction to Quantitative Genetics* (4th Edition) by Falconer & Mackay  
- *Breeding for Quantitative Traits in Plants* (3rd Edition) by Bernardo  
- *Introduction to Genetic Analysis* (10th Edition) by Griffiths, Wessler, Carroll & Doebley  

Additional materials (lecture slides, videos, and R code) are available at:
